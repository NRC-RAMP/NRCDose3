## XOQDOQ modernized into SIERRA
The XOQDOQ code has been updated and modernized into the Routine Release Analysis model of the Atmospheric Transport and Diffusion (ATD) module in Software Integraion for Environmental Radiological Release Assessments (SIERRA) code.  Therefore, XOQDOQ will receive minimal maintenance as the schedule, funding, etc. will be focused on the updated version in SIERRA.  The issues documented here will be for awareness for users.

### About
NRCDose is a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for the LADTAP Il, GASPAR II, and XOQDOQ programs which operate under all Microsoft Windows™ platforms. These Fortran codes implement NRC’s current requirements for As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) for radioactive effluents from nuclear power plants. NRCDose allows the user to enter and retrieve data through a series of windows dialogs, making the use of the program much more user-friendly and efficient than its original design. The NRCDose GUI also allows the user to create sets of data that can be named and retrieved at a later date for review or modification.

LADTAP II is the liquid pathway modeling of NRC RG 1.109. LADTAP II is designed to estimate radiation doses to individuals, population groups, and biota from radionuclides released as liquid effluents from LWRs during routine operation.
GASPAR Il is the gaseous effluent pathway modeling of NRC RG 1.109. GASPAR II is designed to estimate radiation doses to individuals and population groups from radionuclide releases as airborne effluents from LWRs during routine operation.
XOQDOQ is the atmospheric dispersion modeling of RG 1.111. XOQDOQ is designed for evaluating routine releases from nuclear power plants; it primarily is designed to calculate annual relative effluent concentrations, X/Q values, and annual average relative deposition, D/Q values, at locations specified by the user, and at various standard radial distances and segments for downwind sectors.
NRCDose is maintained by Chesapeake Nuclear Services, Inc. (CNS) under contract for the U.S. NRC Office of Research.

NRCDose3 - Is the most recent version of the NRCDose code which includes an updated Windows GUI, an expanded radionuclide library to include 203 radionuclides with dose conversion factors, fully user-modifiable parameters for LADTAP, GASPAR, and XOQDOQ Fortran codes, and compatibility using Windows 7 and above, Internet Explorer Version 7 and above. The more significant updates to NRCDose3 include user options to select from more than one set of DCFs (ICRP-2 [Default], ICRP-30 or ICRP-72) and updated ICRP-72 DCFs for six age groups (infant, 1 yr., 5 yr., 10 yr., 15 yr., and adult).

### Note
NRCDose 3 users should be aware that for purposes of demonstrating compliance with 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix I, and 40 CFR Part 190, only the ICRP-2 DCFs should be selected. Likewise, for demonstrating compliance with 10 CFR Part 20, only the ICRP-30 DCFs should be selected. However, applicants and licensees may propose an alternate method and submit an exemption request to the NRC to use the ICRP-72 DCFs. Any proposal to use the ICRP-72 DCFs should be discussed with the NRC staff before such a request is submitted for NRC review.
